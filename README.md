Hi, I’m Aliya Caldwell (she/they). I am interested in the movement and trophic ecology of seabirds and fishes, and how the predator-prey relationship between seabirds and fishes can be used in fisheries monitoring. I am a PhD student in the Fish and Movement Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire.
